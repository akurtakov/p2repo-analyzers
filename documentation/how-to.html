<h1>Running your own Repository Reports</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document gives a brief outline of how to run the "repo reports" locally, 
against a repository on your local file system. </p>

<p>There are some tests, that look at jars specifically, 
that require the jars to be on local file system and essentially use plain 'ol Java file IO and regex-type checks on 
the contents. 

<p>Another class of tests, read the content.jar/xml meta-data and reports on the data or relationships in 
that meta data. <p>

<p>Yet another, small class of tests, verify the jars are signed. These tests are not really "Java" or "workspace" related, 
but instead, use shell scripts to invoke "jarsigner -verify" repeatedly
on a directory of jars. These shell scripts are not very efficient, but ... do get the basic signature verification checks done 
in the most neutral, flexible way possible. They make 
sure jars are signed and that pack.gz files can be unpacked, and then the signature of the resulting jar verified. 
You can change the 
VM level used since there are known issues with each level of VM; some jars can not be unpacked
with java 5, say, or those with nested jars can not be unpacked with Java 7. Which VM level to use depends on your goals and 
end-user and adopter needs. (We use Java 6 during the report generation on for Simultaneous Release.)</p>

<h2>Running the repo tests</h2>

These instructions are focus for "running from your workspace", but could also easily be done "from the command line" if you know how 
to run Eclipse Applications from the command line. 

<h3>The Basics</h3>

The Eclipse Application is named 'org.eclipse.simrel.tests.repoReport'. It takes two "system properties"; one to specify 
where you want the output to go, and another to specify where the repo is on the file system. For example:
<ul>
<li>-DreportOutputDir=/home/shared/eclipse/repoReport</li> 
<li>-DreportRepoDir=/home/www/html/downloads/eclipse/updates/4.2-I-builds/I20120531-1500/</li> 
</ul>

<h3>The Details</h3>

<p>The source project is named 'org.eclipse.simrel.tests' and is currently in Git in repository named 'simrel/org.eclipse.simrel.tests.git'. See {{Git|simrel|org.eclipse.simrel.tests.git}}.</p>

<p>Once you load that project into your workspace, it will include one "launch configuration" that can be used as a starting example, 
edited and used to launch 
the application from your workspace.<p>

<p>On a large repository, it take 5 or 10 minutes to complete, and then you just to look at the
results (usually) with a web browser starting with the 'index.html' at the location you specified in 'reportOutputDir' property.<p>

<h3>Signing verification</h3>

There are two scripts in the 'org.eclipse.juno.tests' that work together to check signatures: verify.sh and verifydir.sh. Written for Linux, but could be re-written for Windows, I'd guess. I normally put these on my path, such as in my ~/bin directory. The run time, I navigate to the "top" of the repository, and execute ./verifydir.sh which uses the current directory (if none specified) and iterates through all the files looking for "*.jar" and '*pack.gz' files and eventually calls 'verify.sh' on a specific file. You will need to edit verify.sh and define the Java directory on your local system where "jarsigner" can be found. Once ran, the scripts create report files in ~/verifyoutputdir (in your home folder, erasing what ever was there before) and you can check those report files for "errors" or "unsigned" items. 

<h2>Getting help or making contributions</h2>

You can ask questions on cross-project list if the tests do not work as expected. Or, even better, you can make improvements/fixes directly on this wiki, if the instructions can be better. Feel free to supply patches on the cross-project component in bugzilla.
